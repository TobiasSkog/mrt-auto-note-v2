# Notes:
Key thing to remember about raid CDs is to ask yourself “what am I using this for?” Generally there are two answers:
- Survive one single, big hit of damage: AMZ, Barrier, Rally, AM (or combinations of each)
- Survive consistent AOE damage or beat a healing check without lust: Hymns / Tranqs / Spirit Link. 

You gotta also consider if the raid are spread or stacked, because the effectiveness of these CDs heavily depend on that. 

Final note is that it can be good to consider whether it’s wiser to use DPS raid CDs or healer ones too, especially when it comes to Hymns and Tranqs. If there’s a tough DPS check or it’s during lust, it’s probably best to use a healer CD. But if it’s a really tough healing check then it’s actually better to use DPS CDs so that the healers can also continue to do their regular healing rotation on top.
